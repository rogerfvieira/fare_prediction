# fare_prediction

This notebook contains analysis on the taxi cab trips for new york city , a publicly available dataset. The objective is to analyze the data and create a model that can predict fare prices based on selected features. This is to be done using BigQuery and BigqueryML. Down below is the notebook containing the steps via the BQ API using python.

## Important 

unning the notebook locally will raise issues as it is connecting to Google cloud, if you donâ€™t have a google cloud account then just view the cells as they already display the outputs. If you would like to run the notebook locally you must change the project 'play-368717' to your particular project of choice, be aware that this can potentially incur charges on your google cloud platform account so I recommend against this.
